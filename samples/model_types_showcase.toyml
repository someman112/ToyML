# ToyML Model Type Examples

# Simple dataset
Dataset data from "data.csv"
Split data into train, test with ratio=0.8

# Train with different model types
Train train with epochs=5
Train train using linear_regression with lr=0.01
Train train using svm with kernel="rbf", C=1.0
Train train using random_forest with n_estimators=100, max_depth=10
Train train using neural_network with hidden_layers="64,32", activation="relu"

# Evaluate and print
Evaluate model on test
